# HR-Employee-Loss-Prediction

This project contains a work that is use Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms to forecast employee attrition within a human resources dataset. The dataset comprised various features such as age, daily rate, job satisfaction, and years of service, among others. By leveraging machine learning techniques, I aimed to identify patterns and factors contributing to employee turnover. This project is providing detailed insights into the methodology, data analysis, model implementation, and results
